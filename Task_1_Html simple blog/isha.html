<b><P>The authorities of Dhaka University today terminated a professor from his job on charges of distorting the country's history and defaming Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p></b>
<P>The decision to terminate Prof Morshed Hasan Khan was taken at a meeting of the university's syndicate, a member of the syndicate told The Daily Star.<br>
</p>
<p> He was professor of marketing department under the Faculty of Business Studies.</p>
<p>Earlier on April 2, 2018, DU authorities suspended him over allegations of distorting history of the Liberation War and defaming Bangabandhu and said the punishment will be effective until further notice. </p>
<p>Morshed had made some remarks on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and on the history in his article titled "Jyotirmoy Zia", published in a national daily on March 25, 2018.

 </p>
<p> In the article, Morshed termed Ziaur Rahman as the "announcer of independence" and claimed that most of the then Awami League leaders including Bangabandhu left the country during the war. </p>
<p>Soon after publishing the article, activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League protested on the DU campus on the next day.<br>

The BCL men staged a demonstration on the campus demanding punishment of the teacher and declared him "persona non grata".<br>

They also submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor urging the authorities for taking immediate actions against him. Dhaka University Teachers' Association (Duta) in a statement also demanded legal actions against the professor.

Following the protest, Morshed in a Facebook post issued an apology in this regard.  </p>

<b><P>A Rangpur court today discharged a Digital Security Act (DSA) case against a professor of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur (BRUR) which was filed against her over a negative comment she posted on Facebook against former health minister late Mohammad Nasim, who was on life support at the time.</p></b>

Nasim, who was also an Awami League presidium member, passed away on June 13 last year.</p>
<p> On the same day of Nasim's demise, Colonel (retd) Abu Hena Mostafa Kamal, BRUR registrar, filed the case against Munira at the Tajhat Police Station and she was arrested from her residence on BRUR campus that night.<br>
BRUR authority had suspended her from her post on June 17 last year. She landed in Rangpur jail after the arrest but secured bail from the High court on August 5 last year.</p>
